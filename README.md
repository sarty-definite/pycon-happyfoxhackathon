# PyCon25 Hackathon: Intelligent Support Ticket Assignment System

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

### Problem Statement

In a helpdesk system, when customers raise support issues about different topics, we should ideally route tickets to agents who have knowledge and experience in solving that particular set of problems. However:

- **Volume Imbalance**: Not all topics have equal request volumes
- **Skill Gaps**: Not all agents have expertise in all areas
- **Fair Distribution**: Workload needs to be distributed equitably
- **Effective Resolution**: Tickets should go to the most capable agents

### Challenge

Build an optimal routing system that assigns support tickets to the best possible agent while ensuring:
- âœ… Maximum likelihood of successful resolution
- âœ… Fair distribution of workload across agents
- âœ… Effective prioritization of issues
- âœ… Cost-effective and scalable approach

## ðŸ“Š Data Structure

### Input: `dataset.json`
Contains two main sections:
- **Agents**: Support staff with skills, availability, and experience levels
- **Tickets**: Support requests with descriptions and timestamps

### Output: `output_result.json`
Your solution should generate ticket assignments with the following fields:

- **Mandatory:**
   - Ticket ID
   - Assigned Agent ID
- **Optional:**
   - Rationale/Justification for the assignment

## Future Scope
### ðŸš€ **Future Scope - Key Enhancement Areas**

Creating a fuzzy logic which breaks down the ticket into topics and assigning the existing ticket for each agent based on their skill set.
After assignment the float value would then be updated based of their workload. 
For each ticket, complexity would be arranged for each agent and setting up trends based on their past resolutions.

#### ðŸ“Š **Data-Driven Intelligence**
- Historical performance analytics (resolution times, success rates)
- Predictive assignment using past performance data

#### ðŸŽ¯ **Advanced Workload Management**
- Ticket complexity-based workload weighting (1x-5x multipliers)
- Agent-specific workload thresholds based on experience
- Real-time workload rebalancing

#### ï¿½ï¿½ **Real-Time Processing**
- Live ticket assignment as tickets arrive
- Dynamic agent availability management
- Auto-escalation when no suitable agents available
- Load shedding during capacity constraints

#### ðŸ¤– **AI/ML Integration**
- NLP for ticket sentiment and complexity analysis
- Predictive maintenance and capacity planning
- Skill gap prediction
- Escalation probability modeling

### ðŸ“Š **Implementation Priority**
1. **Phase 1**: Performance tracking + complexity weighting
2. **Phase 2**: ML integration + real-time processing  
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced analytics + multi-channel support
4. **Phase 4**: Enterprise features + compliance
